This is a placeholder for the hero-dashboard.png image.

Since we can't directly create a binary image file through text editing, you should:

1. Create or find a suitable dashboard screenshot image
2. Name it "hero-dashboard.png"
3. Place it in the public/images/ directory

For now, you can use a placeholder image service like:

Or create a simple dashboard mockup using a design tool like Figma or Canva.
