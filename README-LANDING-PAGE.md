# InflateMate Landing Page Setup

## Image Requirements

The new landing page requires several images to be placed in the `/public/images/` directory:

1. **hero-dashboard.png** - A screenshot or mockup of the InflateMate dashboard (1200x800px recommended)
2. **testimonial1.jpg** - Headshot/avatar for the first testimonial (300x300px recommended)
3. **testimonial2.jpg** - Headshot/avatar for the second testimonial (300x300px recommended)
4. **testimonial3.jpg** - Headshot/avatar for the third testimonial (300x300px recommended)

You can use placeholder images temporarily:
- Dashboard: https://placehold.co/1200x800/0066ff/ffffff?text=InflateMate+Dashboard
- Testimonials: https://placehold.co/300x300/cccccc/666666?text=Testimonial

## Animation CSS

The landing page uses custom animations for the floating elements. These have been added to the `globals.css` file.

## Pricing

The basic plan is set at $100/month as requested, with the Pro plan at $200/month and the Business plan at $350/month.

## Responsive Design

The landing page is fully responsive and works well on:
- Mobile devices (< 640px)
- Tablets (640px - 1024px)
- Desktop (> 1024px)

## Navigation

The navigation bar has been updated to be more playful and bounce-house themed, with improved mobile responsiveness.

## Footer

The footer has been redesigned to match the fun, playful theme of the bounce house business.
