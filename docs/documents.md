Inflatemate aims to streamline the process of managing waivers and contracts by automating the generation, signing, and tracking of these documents in a digital workflow. The goal is to create a dynamic, personalized waiver or contract each time a customer books a service. This document will incorporate customer-specific and business-specific information through a templated approach, ensuring that every generated PDF is tailored to the individual case while maintaining consistency and legal compliance. Once the dynamic PDF is generated, it will be sent to a digital signature service (such as OpenSign, a free open-source alternative) to allow for secure electronic signing, and its status will be tracked in your database.

To implement this solution, you would start by extending your Prisma schema with a new Waiver model to record details like business ID, customer ID, booking ID (if applicable), document type, status, and the URL for the generated PDF. Next, in your Next.js application, build a React component that serves as your waiver template with dynamic placeholders, then create an API route using Puppeteer to render this component into a PDF. After generating the PDF, integrate with OpenSignâ€™s API to initiate the signing process and retrieve a signing URL. Finally, use Resend to email the customer this signing link, while updating the waiver record in your database with the current status. This approach keeps the system lean and cost-effective while ensuring that each waiver is personalized, securely signed, and easily tracked.
