🧠 What InflateMate Does
InflateMate is a business management platform designed specifically for bounce house rental companies. It helps owners manage every part of their operation in one place — without the bloated, outdated UX of legacy platforms like Inflatable Office or Goodshuffle Pro.

🛠️ Core Features (you’ll be implementing or supporting):
Online Booking System

Customers can browse inventory and make bookings via a custom tenant website.

Booking rules: buffer times, minimum notice, rental windows.

Supabase stores booking data and availability.

Inventory Management

Tenants can upload their inflatables (using UploadThing).

Tag items by type (e.g., waterslides, combo units).

View booking frequency and top items via dashboard analytics.

CRM (Customer Relationship Management)

Tracks customer profiles, booking history, and allows basic contact logging.

Eventually will support customer tagging and segmentation.

Invoicing & Estimate System

Create and send quotes to clients (estimate -> invoice flow).

Stripe integration for payments (connected accounts).

Automated Documents & Emails

Auto-send waivers (via DocuSeal or another API) after booking.

Confirmation emails and receipts (via Resend).

Website Builder

Each tenant gets a simple customizable site with up to 5 theme colors and layout options.

Option to embed booking components on their own external site.

Marketing Tools

Coupon and funnel builder: create popups that offer a discount in exchange for lead capture.

Leads tracked on their dashboard.

Org Team Access

Tenants can invite up to 5 users to help manage the business.

(Soon) SMS Notifications

Will use Twilio or similar for two-way messaging with clients.

💥 Why It’s Different (Important for Tone & UX Decisions)
Clean, modern UI (think Tailwind + Stripe aesthetic)

Simple pricing (no nickel-and-diming for core features)

Built by a bounce house business owner, so it solves real operational pain

Competitor software is outdated, hard to use, and overpriced
